Rails Microservice for Post Likes

## Overview
This project implements a microservice to handle "likes" for posts in a system that may involve pets or similar entities. It is built with Ruby on Rails and incorporates features like **WebSocket** for real-time updates using **ActionCable**. The service also supports JWT-based authentication for secure access to the like functionality.
